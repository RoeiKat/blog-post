# MERN blog-post

## Roei Katabi

## Desc -
An application fully using the MERN stack to make an blog post app with signing up and logging in functions.

### Currently not working - 
1) Comment section
2) Form Validation

#### Most Difficult - 
I didn't work on Back-End development for a while so I needed a quick refresh on working with MongoDB and mongoose.

##### Future Improvments - 
Working on all the app functionality in general.
Fixing the Comment section Back-End side and on the Front-End aswell , another SUPER important feature is  adding the Form validation.

######
Hope you have a great time browsing the app!!!
