# MERN blog-post

## Roei Katabi

### Description -
A blog web - application using the MERN stack. 
You can Register, Login and then submit posts and add comment to your favorite posts!.

### Dependency - 
1) Express
2) Mongoose
3) react-router-dom
4) passport
5) passport-local

### Most Difficult - 
The styling of the app was difficult for me since I am a creative person, I take a lot of time designing and making sure everything fits in its space.
And the programming of the Back-end took me a while since I needed a quick refresh on MongoDB and Mongoose.
Plus I haven't tried any form of code test.

#### Future Improvments - 
1)Adding relations between comments and the users, same goes for the posts.
2)Working on Form-validation on the Front-End and the Back-End.
3)Adding a session so you could stay logged in even when you refresh.

#### Known Bugs - 
When you refresh the page you get logged out which is kind of annoying.
and the "Go back" button on the Login Component and the Register Component may have some issues going to the root page.

Hope you have a great time browsing the application and the code!
